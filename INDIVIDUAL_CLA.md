5.	Original Work:
You represent that each of Your Contributions are Your original works of authorship (see Section 7 - Submission on behalf of others). You represent that to Your knowledge, no other person claims, or has the right to claim, any right in any intellectual property right related to Your Contributions.
You also represent that You are not legally obligated, whether by entering into an agreement or otherwise, in any way that conflicts with the terms of this Agreement.
You represent that Your Contribution submissions include complete details of any third-party license or other restriction (including, but not limited to, related patents and trademarks) of which You are personally aware and which are associated with any part of Your Contributions.
